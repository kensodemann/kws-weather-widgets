# My Weather Widgets

This is a sample web component library that contains some simple weather related widgets. This library contains the following components:

* Simple
  * **kws-temperature** - takes a temperature in Kelvin and displays the value in either Celcius or Fahrenheit
  * **kws-uv-index** - takes a UV Index value and displays the value with a description and color coding
  * **kws-condition** - given a mapping of condition types to image URLs and a condition code, determines which code to use and displays the image with a label
* Compound
  * **kws-daily-forecast** - condition, date, low, high

## Usage

Include the library in your project: `npm i kws-weather-widgets`

The Stencil documentation site has an excellent [Framework Integration Guide](https://stenciljs.com/docs/framework-integration). Following that to guide to integrate the library with your project.

**Note:** if you are using Vue, the prefix used is `kws` so the `ignoredElements`  line is `Vue.config.ignoredElements = [/kws-\w*/];`.

### Images

This library does not include its own images. In order to inform the library how to get the images to use, you need to set up a map that specifies the image file to use for each of the weather conditions.

Here is an example:


```TypeScript
export class IconMap {
  sunny = 'assets/images/sunny.png';
  cloudy = 'assets/images/cloudy.png';
  lightRain = 'assets/images/rain.png';
  shower = 'assets/images/shower.png';
  sunnyThunderStorm = 'assets/images/partial-tstorm.png';
  thunderStorm = 'assets/images/tstorm.png';
  fog = 'assets/images/fog.png';
  snow = 'assets/images/snow.png';
  unknown = 'assets/images/unknown.png';
}
```

### Components

Any component that take a `condition` assumes that the condition is one of the [condition codes](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions) used by [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org).

Examples shown below are using Angular property bindings. Use whatever is appropriate for the architecture of your application.

#### `kws-temperature`

Displays the `temperature`, given in Kelvin, in the given `scale` (C or F).
```html
<kws-temperature scale="F" temperature="297"></kws-temperature>
```

#### `kws-condition`

Displays the current condition in both text and icon form.

```html
<kws-condition [condition]="200" [iconPaths]="iconMap"></kws-condition>
```

#### `kws-daily-forecast`

Displays the forcast for a given day.

```html
<kws-daily-forecast scale="F" [forecasts]="forecastData" [iconPaths]="iconMap"></kws-daily-forecast>
```

The forecast property is an array of forecast data for a single day in the following format:

```TypeScript
export interface Forecast {
  date: Date;
  condition: number;
  temperature: number;
}
```

This data will be the weather conditions every X hours throughout the day. The component figures out a general condition to use for that day from the given data.

The temperature is specified in Kelvin.

#### `kws-uv-index`

Displays the UV index along with a risk level, in a color appropriate for the level of risk.

```html
<kws-uv-index [uvIndex]="value"></kws-uv-index>
```
